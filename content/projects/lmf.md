LMF needed E-Commerce functionality, so I setup and configured WooCommerce, set the price point variables so patrons could choose their donation amount, as well as automatic tax invoicing and purchase emails through WooCommerce PDF invoicing. They can raise money year round as opposed to only via event and sponsorships.
