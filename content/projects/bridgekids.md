WWW projects is an engineering company that had it's website built in 2006. You can see in the before picture it is clearly out of date and had poor UI. It was not mobile responsive which is a MUST. The client wanted the same colour scheme, with a refreshed and updated look, navigation and UI to bring his website from 2006 to 2022.
