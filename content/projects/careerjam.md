Career Jam is a career retraining company. Rebecca wanted a very specific look and feel to her website, which is targeting mid life and mid career professionals seeking a change. We built her website on Gutenberg, and are going to be integrating her courses on thinkific. We also have added active campaign integration, as well as paypal, and plan to develop custom marketing templates. She has already received enquiries to her wait list and and is going to do a course launch at Easter. This is an ongoing development project.
