Elissa Hill is a communications specialist, and she wanted to make sure her website reflected her style guide and brand values. Elissa had started the project with another developer, but multiple tasks were incomplete so I worked with Elissa and the design agency brief she provided me. The end result is a beautiful website, updated with her new brand colours, Wp forms and crystal clear svg icons.
